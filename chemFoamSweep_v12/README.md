****my_chemFoam* example cases:***

*my_chemFoam* uses custom chemistryModel and ODE libraries. One major update is on the calculation of Jacobian matrix. OpenFOAM-v12 uses mass fraction based constant pressure (CONP) ODE system for the chemistry integration. Founding fathers of CHEMKIN used Finite Difference (FD) Jacobian (an expensive method - author used this method to diagnose bugs in the equation set called by Derivatives by isolating the calls from Jacobian). The first analytical Jacobian for CONP problem is from Schwartz et al (William Green's group at MIT) using automatic differentiation tools. Tianfeng Lu (UCONN) used the same tool in developing a hybrid ODE integration method. Author noticed some human-coded CONP analytical Jacobians (OpenFOAM is included) but did not satisfy with their performances. Here, author derived, hand-calculated and approximated each Jacobian term carefully. Then, he extended these calculations for three separate ODE systems based on concentrations, mole-fractions, and mass fractions to ensure that approximations are valid.
